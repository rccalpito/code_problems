# The above data represents a binary tree structure, nodes are uniquely identified through a path of IDs,
# starting from the root down to the specific node. This path is a string format consisting of IDs separated
# by dots (.), where the leftmost ID represents the root, and each subsequent ID indicates a child node as
# one descends through the tree.

# For example, the path "19.56.45" corresponds to a node with ID 45, which is a child of node 56, itself a
# child of the root node 19.

# Your task is to implement the following in ruby:

# You may use any string methods and array/hash methods to help you solve the problem (map, sort, filter, ...).
# All functions must be pure (do not modify the original data)

# 1. self_and_descendants
# Signature: selfAndDescendants(path: string): Array<number>
# Input: path - a string representing the path of IDs from the root to a specific node.
# Output: A list of IDs for the node identified by path and all its descendants, starting with the ID of the
# node specified by path, followed by the IDs of its descendants in no particular order.
# If the path does not lead to a valid node, return an empty list.

# 2. move_node
# Signature: moveNode(currentPath: string, newPath: string): Array<Hash>
# Operation: Moves the node identified by currentPath to the path identified by newPath.
# Inputs:
# currentPath - the current path string that identifies the node to be moved.
# newPath - the path string that identifies the new path of the node.
# position - the new position of the node relative to it's new siblings.
# Output: An array of hashes representing the new tree structure after the move operation.
# array should contain the path and position of the node.

# 3. children
# Signature: children(path: string): Array<Hash>
# Input: path - a string representing the path of IDs from the root to a specific node.
# Output: An array of hashes representing the children of the node identified by path ORDERED BY POSITION.
